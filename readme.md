# M3U2 VOD Script Overview

This script keeps your **VOD library organized and current** by syncing an IPTV playlist (`VOD.m3u`) with your local media and `.strm` files.

---

## How It Works

1. **Scan Local Media**
   - Searches your existing movie and TV folders.
   - Builds a cache of everything you already have locally.

2. **Read the VOD Playlist**
   - Parses your IPTV `.m3u` file (local file or URL).
   - Lists all available titles and their stream URLs.

3. **Filter by Region**
   - Uses the TMDb API to confirm each title is from an allowed country (e.g., US, GB, CA).
   - Excluded titles are logged to `excluded_entries.txt` for review.

4. **Compare and Sync**
   - If a title already exists locally, it's skipped.
   - If missing, the script creates a `.strm` file pointing to the IPTV stream.
   - Maintains a SQLite cache to track what's new, changed, or skipped.

5. **Clean Up**
   - Removes `.strm` files that are no longer valid or missing from the playlist.
   - Cleans up empty folders or NFO-only directories.

6. **Optional: Refresh Emby**
   - After updates, the script can automatically trigger an Emby library refresh.

## Result

- Only **new or missing** titles are added as `.strm` links.
- **Out-of-region** content is excluded.
- **Local media** remains untouched.
- **Emby** (if configured) updates automatically.
